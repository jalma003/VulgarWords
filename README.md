# VulgarWords
Senior design project for cs179

This Big Data project was designed to show the tweet vulgarity ratio of each state. We also thought that it would be interesting to add high school graduation rates to see if there were any correlation between it and the vulgarity ratios.

For the front-end we used the map provided by leaflet. We also used AngularJs.

For the Back-End we used the no-sql Cassandra Database to store our data. Hadoop to process our data. And a RESTful API to access our data.

If the servers are unresposive, please email john.m.almaraz@gmail.com for further assistance.
